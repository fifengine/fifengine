== Introduction ==
Welcome to the FIFE v0.3.2r2 README. This snapshot is based on SVN revision 3525.

== Table of contents ==
1 Features
2 License
3 FIFE Clients
4 Known Issues
5 Feedback
6 Closing Notes


== 1) Features ==
A complete list of the features that FIFE offers can be found at the project wiki:
 * http://wiki.fifengine.net/Features


== 2) License ==
The source code (*.cpp, *.h & *.py) is licensed under LGPL 2.1 or newer:
 * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

Content was taken from a lot a lot of different 3rd party sources. Therefore each 
client directory comes with a separate LICENSE file that states the origin of the 
content, the author and the actual license it was published under.


== 3) FIFE Clients ==

=== 3.1) Editor ===
The editor tool can be found within the <FIFE>/tools/editor directory. You can 
launch it by running 'run.py'.  It is used to edit map files for the tech demo 
(rio do hola).  Other clients extend it and use it to edit their maps.


=== 3.2) Rio De Hola ===
Rio de hola is a technology demo showing off many of the FIFE features.  It is 
located in the <FIFE>/demos/rio_de_hola directory and can be launched by running 
run.py.  It was at one time meant to be an example game but we have moved away 
from that idea and it is now more of a technology demo and a playground for 
developers to test their code.  It does serve as a good starting point for people 
wishing to play around with FIFE or base your game off of.


=== 3.3) Shooter Demo ===
The Shooter demo was an attempt to show the versatility and flexibility of FIFE.
It is a simple side scrolling shooter that has a main menu, one level and an
end boss.  Try your luck and see if you can defeat the boss!


=== 3.4) PyChan Example ===
Last but not least there is an example client residing in <FIFE>\demos\pychan_demo 
that shows how the pychan GUI library works. Start the GUI demo application by 
running pychan_test.py.


=== 3.5) Configuring the Clients ===
The engine utilizes special settings files for configuring FIFE. This file is called 
settings.py and resides in the same directory as the <FIFE>/clients/<CLIENT>/run.py 
scripts. You can customize FIFE by editing this file.


== 4) Known issues ==
 * Cannot build a usable debug version of _fife_d.pyd with mingw
 * Win32 users tend to suffer from problems with the OpenAL drivers. If you don't 
   hear sound while running a FIFE client, run oalinst.exe that ships with the 
   Win32 FIFE Development Kit.  This is the latest OpenAL driver for Win32.
 * The unittests are broken on Win32 (if used in combination with scons & mingw).
 * Cannot show/hide child widgets in containers (#357)
 * No non-renderable font image when a character is not found (#302)
 * Guichan widgets do not correctly handle meta characters (shift, ctrl, alt, 
   etc) (#412)
 * Cameras must be attached to layers and not maps as they should be (#305)
 * Map editor clobbers custom attribues in map file (#379)
 * Must use modified guichan for UTF8 support (#432)
 * Button Doesn't react to click when drawn below mouse poiner (#387)
 * The spacer concept in pychan does not work as expected (#490)
 * No soname for libfife.so (#435)
 * Pychan dropdowns refuse to open if there is no space below (#445)
 * Slider size is overwritten by label max_size when residing in the same 
   (parent) box (#488)
 * Map editor clobbers ccustom attributes (#379)
 * Editor crashes after docking the object editor and closing map (#450)
 * History bugs and (many) other related bugs (#452, #459)
 * Cannot default zoom level for a camera (#467)
 * Cannot add additional import statements (#468)
 * Loaders contain a circular import (#478)

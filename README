== Introduction ==
Welcome to the FIFE v0.3.3 README. This snapshot is based on SVN revision 3750.

== Table of contents ==
1 Features
2 License
3 FIFE Clients
4 Known Issues
5 Troubleshooting
6 Feedback
7 Closing Notes


== 1) Features ==
A complete list of the features that FIFE offers can be found at the project wiki:
 * http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Engine_features


== 2) License ==
The source code (*.cpp, *.h & *.py) is licensed under LGPL 2.1 or newer:
 * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

Content was taken from a lot a lot of different 3rd party sources. Therefore each 
client directory comes with a separate LICENSE file that states the origin of the 
content, the author and the actual license it was published under.


== 3) FIFE Clients ==

=== 3.1) Editor ===
The editor tool can be found within the <FIFE>/tools/editor directory. You can 
launch it by running 'run.py'.  It is used to edit map files for the tech demo 
(rio do hola).  Other clients extend it and use it to edit their maps.


=== 3.2) Rio De Hola ===
Rio de hola is a technology demo showing off many of the FIFE features.  It is 
located in the <FIFE>/demos/rio_de_hola directory and can be launched by running 
run.py.  It was at one time meant to be an example game but we have moved away 
from that idea and it is now more of a technology demo and a playground for 
developers to test their code.  It does serve as a good starting point for people 
wishing to play around with FIFE or base your game off of.


=== 3.3) Shooter Demo ===
The Shooter demo was an attempt to show the versatility and flexibility of FIFE.
It is a simple side scrolling shooter that has a main menu, one level and an
end boss.  Try your luck and see if you can defeat the boss!


=== 3.4) PyChan Example ===
Last but not least there is an example client residing in <FIFE>\demos\pychan_demo 
that shows how the pychan GUI library works. Start the GUI demo application by 
running pychan_test.py.


=== 3.5) Configuring the Clients ===
The engine utilizes special settings files for configuring FIFE. This file is called 
settings.xml and resides in your home directory (in Application Data for Windows users).
For the Shooter demo this file is in the same directory as the shooter demo.


== 4) Known issues ==
Documentation
 * Bug in dep_analyzer.py which prevents graphs from being generated (#554)
 * Crashing when making application window active in Mac OSX (#515)
 * Some unit tests are broken (#423)
 * Atlas Creator needs to be documented (#559)

== 5) Troubleshooting ==

=== Video Card/Driver Issues ===
There are some known driver/card combinations that exhibit the some problems
with FIFE.  Users have reported seeing blank screens or fuzzy images.  If this 
is happening to you please report it on our forums in the Help and 
troubleshooting section here: http://forums.fifengine.net/index.php?board=4.0
Please include your Card/Driver/OS information in your post.  Currently the fix
is to modify your settings.xml file and set both GLUseFramebuffer and GLUseNPOT
to False (they are True by default).

== 6) Feedback ==
We appreciate every kind of feedback concerning the release, the project in general 
and the bundled techdemo. Feedback is a great way to help us to improve FIFE. If you 
would like to get in contact with us and provide feedback you can either visit our 
IRC channel or our forums:

== Introduction ==
Welcome to the FIFE v0.3.3r3 README. This snapshot is based on SVN revision 3910

== Table of contents ==
1 Features
2 License
3 FIFE Clients
4 Known Issues
5 Troubleshooting
6 Feedback
7 Closing Notes


== 1) Features ==
A complete list of the features that FIFE offers can be found at the project 
wiki:
 * http://wiki.fifengine.de/index.php?title=Engine_features


== 2) License ==
The source code (*.cpp, *.h & *.py) is licensed under LGPL 2.1 or newer:
 * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

Content was taken from a lot a lot of different 3rd party sources. Therefore 
each client directory comes with a separate LICENSE file that states the origin
of the content, the author and the actual license it was published under.


== 3) FIFE Clients ==

=== 3.1) Editor ===
The editor tool can be found within the <FIFE>/tools/editor directory. You can 
launch it by running 'run.py'.  It is used to edit map files for the tech demo 
(rio do hola).  Other clients extend it and use it to edit their maps.

=== 3.2) Rio De Hola ===
Rio de hola is a technology demo showing off many of the FIFE features.  It is 
located in the <FIFE>/demos/rio_de_hola directory and can be launched by 
running run.py.  It was at one time meant to be an example game but we have 
moved away from that idea and it is now more of a technology demo and a 
playground for developers to test their code.  It does serve as a good starting
point for people wishing to play around with FIFE or base your game off of.

=== 3.3) Shooter Demo ===
The Shooter demo was an attempt to show the versatility and flexibility of FIFE.
It is a simple side scrolling shooter that has a main menu, one level and an
end boss.  Try your luck and see if you can defeat the boss!

=== 3.4) PyChan Demo ===
Last but not least there is an example client residing in 
<FIFE>\demos\pychan_demo that shows how the pychan GUI library works. Start the
GUI demo application by running pychan_test.py.

=== 3.5) Configuring the Editor and Demos ===
The engine utilizes special settings files for configuring FIFE. This file is 
called settings.xml and resides in the ~/.fife directory (in 
<User>/Application Data/fife for Windows users).  The Shooter Demo and the
PyChan demo are exceptions.  They both store their settings.xml file in their
root directories.

NOTE that the settings.xml file is auto generated and wont be there until you
run the demos for the first time.  FIFE automatically fills the settings file
with default values.  For more information on FIFE settings please see the wiki
page here: http://wiki.fifengine.net/Engine_Extensions#Engine_Settings

== 5) Troubleshooting ==

=== Video Card/Driver Issues ===
There are some known driver/card combinations that exhibit the some problems
with FIFE.  Users have reported seeing blank screens or fuzzy images.  If this 
is happening to you please report it on our forums in the Help and 
troubleshooting section here: http://forums.fifengine.net/index.php?board=4.0
Please include your Card/Driver/OS information in your post.  Currently the fix
is to modify your settings.xml file and set both GLUseFramebuffer and GLUseNPOT
to False (they are True by default).

=== Audio ===
Win32 users tend to suffer from problems with the OpenAL drivers. If you don't 
hear sound while running a FIFE client, run oalinst.exe that ships with the
Win32 FIFE Development Kit.  This is the latest OpenAL driver for Win32.

== 6) Feedback ==
We appreciate every kind of feedback concerning the release, the project in 
general and the bundled techdemo. Feedback is a great way to help us to improve 
FIFE. If you would like to get in contact with us and provide feedback you can

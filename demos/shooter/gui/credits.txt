--== FIFE Shooter ==-        

This demo was created by the FIFE team to show the 
versatility of the FIFEngine.  We hope that it 
will attract some new projects to use FIFE so we 
can grow our community!

All ship art (objects/ships/*) were graciously 
provided by JP of Castle Games Inc. Visit 
http://www.castlegamesinc.com for more info.

The background music (music/waynesmind.ogg) was 
written and composed by Murray Krawchuck.  

All sound effects were generated with sfxr.

Thanks for checking this demo out,

The FIFE team!

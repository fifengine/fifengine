"""Multi-consumer multi-producer dispatching mechanism

Originally based on pydispatch (BSD) http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyDispatcher/2.0.1
See license.txt for original license.

Heavily modified for Django's purposes.

Copied from django v1.1 beta 1
Changes:
 * Receivers aren't needed to accept any arguments
 * _live_receivers() now work on a copy of self.receivers, which fixes a bug when
   connecting and disconnecting during send()

FIFE Tools
==========

Over time we have come up with specific tools to help you generate content for
FIFE.  This file documents these tools, and where you will find them useful.
It should be kept up to date.  If you notice a tool listed under **current**
that is in fact outdated or no longer working please create an Issue on GitHub
to either update the tool or remove it altogether.

### Editor (also known as FIFEdit)

This is our main map editor.  It's features are currently evolving quickly so
there is no real formal documentation for it yet (we need your help!!).  It
currently isn'ts bundled with FIFE and can be found in it's own [repo](https://github.com/fifengine/fifengine-editor).

### geometry_twister.py

Visually test map tilting and rotation values.  This is useful for determining
the camera settings you should use when creating a new map.

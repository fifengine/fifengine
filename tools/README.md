### geometry_twister.py

Visually test map tilting and rotation values.  This is useful for determining
the camera settings you should use when creating a new map.

### fontdefupgrader.py

Converts old pychan .fontdef files to the new xml based format. Run as follows:

    python fontdefupgrader.py [file1] [file2] ...

It creates new .xml files alongside the old .fontdef files.

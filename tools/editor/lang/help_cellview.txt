Usage:
------

Activate the plugin and select a cell on the mapview.
The instances within the selected cell will be shown
in the gui, along with some infos (object id, stackpos).

MOUSE:
 - RMB resets the plugin, make sure to use it once
   you want to work with a different editor component
 - Select an instance entry in the gui to set the focus
   on this instance

Instance editing:
  - you can manipulate the stackpos of an instance via
    the two provided buttons (+/-). Min is 0, Max is 255
  - you can move a focused instance via editor move tool
    (select the entry in the gui, hit 'm' and grab the instance
     on the mapview)
 
User interface:
---------------

- Layercoordinates of the current selected cells
- Instances within a cell
- Stackpos

Limitations:
------------

- CellView cannot sort the given instances
  introducing a stackpos-sort might be helpful

About
-----

The CellView plugin was originally written
by the Zero-Projekt team and allows to manipulate
cells. Vanilla Editor is able to dump instances in 
one cell, but does not provide an interface to move
a particular instance out of a cell if there is more
then one instance. The result was that all instances
were moved. This is where CellView comes into the game.

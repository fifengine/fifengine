Usage:
------

Activate the plugin and select an instance. The selected
instance will be highlighted, the plugin is set to 
visible or is updated accordingly.

MOUSEWHEEL:
 - above the offset labels, it allows quick de-/
   increasing of values
 - above dropdowns, it allows to change to the
   next entry (and apply it, e.g. animation viewer 
   seamlessly plays the next selected animation)

Object editing:
By selecting a rotation, you can alter the offset of 
_this_ angle and save it to the object file. The 
selected instance is just an interface to see your 
changes - you can't change a single instances offset.

Instance editing:
Instances can't be edited - you can only type in an id
which is set if it is unique. Saving your map also saves
this id to your mapfile.

Animation editing:
ATM it is not possible to alter animations. You can
use the animation viewer to check your defined actions
though.

  Buttons:
   - p = "Play"
   - S = "Start"
   - E = "End"
   - l1 = "one frame left"
   - r1 = "one frame right
 
User interface:
---------------

The object section allows you to inspect:
- namespace of the object
- object id
- blocking flag
- static flag
- current x/y offset

The instance section shows:
- instance id
- instance rotation

The animation viewer shows:
- nothing, if a static instance is clicked
- all actions of an instance
- a control panel to play the animations

The purpose of this plugin is to:

- edit object xml files
- edit the instance id of the selected instance
- provide an animation viewer

The main purpose is to easily change offsets and
save these changes. (extremely helpful for the
creation of tiled walls)

Limitations:
------------

- only object data is saved
- instances on the map are _not_ touched
- exception is the instance id, this can be
  altered via this plugin
- animations can't be edited and / or saved

About
-----

The Object Edit plugin was originally written
by the Zero-Projekt team and was contributed to
FIFE as an example for the editor plugin system
and to encourage other projects within the FIFE
community to also contribute their tools to
enhance the Editor for all projects

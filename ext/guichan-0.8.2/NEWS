the HGE support and the OpenLayer support was added.

2007-06-30 Ninth Beta release Guichan 0.7.0

The new version of Guichan contains support for the library OpenLayer 
and experimental support for the library HGE. As users have had many 
problems related to binary incompatibility with DLLs we are not going

by simply including the source of Guichan in to the project using Guichan.

2006-06-29 Sixth Beta release Guichan 0.5.0

After a long awating comes the sixth beta release of Guichan. The major
change since the last version is a refactoring of the way Guichan handles
images, it should now be easier to extend Guichan with backends for 
graphics handling. Also, containers have gone through a refactoring as 
well making it much easier to make container widgets of your own.

2005-05-17 Fith Beta release (and Norways national day) Guichan 0.4.0

Again a big thank you to Thorbjørn Lindeijer. This Guichan release 
contains many API improvements suggested by Thorbjørn. 

2004-12-17 Third Beta release Guichan 0.2.0

Here comes a new version of Guichan! This could be seen as
a "half release" of sorts, there were some things we would have
liked to put in this release, but didn't. We felt it was more
important to get a new version out before christmas, as a lot of
bugs had been fixed. See the ChangeLog for further details.

Big thanks goes to Thorbjørn Lindeijer and the rest of 
"The Mana World"-team for helping in finding bugs, and suggesting
API improvements (that you probably will see implemented in 0.3.0)

2004-09-24 Second Beta release Guichan 0.1.0

Ten days after the first Beta comes the second which contains

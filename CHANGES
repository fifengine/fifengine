== 2008.1 (July, 2008) ==

=== Model improvements & simplifications ===
 * Elevations removed (Fallout legacy).
 * Support for namespaces:
  * New resource infrastructure migrated into whole engine. This enables:
   * uniform pooling for all resources that need to be pooled.
   * uniform loading for all resources (model stuff, images, sounds...).
   * uniform saving for resources which support saving (model stuff).
  * Datasets are now stored in a flat list in model instead of dataset hierarchy.
  * Changes in model are now bookkeeped. Observer interfaces provided for change listeners.
   * This enables e.g. reacting only to changes instead of polling on every round.
   * Also critical enabler for triggers.
  * Instances now support initial rotation value.
  * Objects support default actions.
  * Further model cleanup.

=== XML format changes ===
 * All resources are now defined with principle 1 file / 1 resource.
 * Importing of objects can now be done also based on directories where they are contained.
 * Relative paths are now used instead of absolute ones.

=== Loaders ===
 * All loading happens now from python (tinyxml dependency removed).
 * Improved error reporting.

=== Editor ===
 * Possibility to move instances on map.
 * Possibility to rotate instances on map.
 * Possibility to zoom the map (OpenGL mode only).
 * Painting with currently selected instance (e.g. large ground areas).
 * Importing of multiple objects based on given directory.
 * Initial map creation wizard (still work in progress).

=== Rio de hola ===
 * More assets:
  * Graphics, sounds, music...
  * Two new maps matching the storyline.
  * Rio de hola now conforms to package structure: http://wiki.fifengine.de/Fife_Package_Specification
  * Popup menu integration, demonstration of actions (kick, talk).

=== Pychan improvements ===
 * Hiding of scrollbars.
 * Text wrapping.
 * A lot of smaller improvements. 

=== Functionality ===
 * Pixel perfect instance picking (taking transparency into account).
 * Ability to get list of instances from given screen rectangle.
 * Distance calculations made easy, exposed to scripts.
 * Instance outlining.
 * Instance coloring.
 * Screenshots are now saved in png format (instead of bmp).
 * Stereo sound support in linux (introduced with the help of openal-soft).

=== Video / view improvements ===
 * Both renderbackend and separate images can now render graphical primitives (e.g. lines, dots..).
 * Each camera now has separate set of renderers. Allows truly adjusting cameras independently.
 * Zooming capability (currently properly supported only by OpenGL backend).
 * Support for drag cursor definitions.
 * OpenGL graphics chunking size is now definable in settings. Should help e.g. with large backgrounds.
 * GenericRenderer adding customised rendering capabilities for scripts.

=== Misc. changes ===
 * Initial package structure defined for FIFE clients.
 * Updated guichan to the latest release 0.8.1.
 * Usage of unittest++ instead of boost unittests.
 * Lots of bug fixes.

=== Non-code related changes ===
 * Switch from GPL 2.0 to LGPL 2.1 (or newer).

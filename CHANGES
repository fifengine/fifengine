=== Video / view improvements ===
 * Both renderbackend and separate images can now render graphical primitives (e.g. lines, dots..).
 * Each camera now has separate set of renderers. Allows truly adjusting cameras independently.
 * Zooming capability (currently properly supported only by OpenGL backend).

================================================================================

=== Engine ===
  * Removed the Camreazone renderer
  * Added light support (OpenGL only) by merging the light branch.  Speacial
    thanks to Helios for all his hard work in this area (#364)
  * Added a percentage bar widget (#411)
  * Modified some size_t definitions to more appropriate ones (#152)

  * Removed the last 0(n) loop through instances when rendering (#419)
  * Generic renderer now only renders objects on the specified layer (#458)
  * Fixed a memory leak when deleting maps.  The camera was not being
    deleted
  * Removed the NotFound exceptions in layer.getInstance() and model.getObjects()
    to be more consistent with the rest of the API
  * Fixed a bug in RenderBackendSDL, the clip area was not properly set
  * Renamed the backquad and border commands of the FloatingTextRenderer
  * Added the TransparentArea commands to the InstanceRenderer
  * Improved InstanceRenderer::addTransparentArea.  You can now pass a list
    of namespaces to be marked as transparent
  * Updated Instance to no longer derive from ResourceClass. It now derives from 
    FifeClass directly
  * Improved the floatingtextrenderer. Now you can set an alpha value for font, 
    background quad and border. Split quad and border into own commands
  * Added a triangle function to backend and genericrenderer, also added the 
    functions to set an alpha value for geometric figures
  * floatingtextrenderer now can change colors of the font via 
    setColor(uint r, uint b, uint g)
  * Added the colorbuffer patch with a small change due to SDL. Performance 
    boost between under OpenGL
  * Improved the most renderers with setColor() function to allow the user to
    modify the color used to render the primitives
  * Fixed the genericrenderer.  It is now tested whether the images are in the 
    viewport
  * Fixed the gridrenderer to only render the grin within the viewport
  * Changed the vertex functions in opengl/renderbackendopengl.cpp from vertex3f() 
    to vertex2f()
  * Moved the layer visibility and transparency, from instancerenderer.cpp to 
    layercache.cpp and improved it (r3395) 
  * Corrected the h,w calculation for zooming in layercache.cpp (r3369)
  * Fixed the bug, that x,y camera position result in an screen offset. (r3369)
  * GLImage now only creates one "texture chunk" (r3445, r3452)
  * Added nextPow2() math function (r3445)
  * Fixed color mask definitions and use them throughout the engine (r3445)
  * Moved the GLEnable and GLDisable structures to be globally accessible (r3445)

  * Added some typedefs: Rect, FloatRect, DoubleRect (r3447)
  * Removed the unused "trigger" system as it was unused (r3449)
  * Applied GreyGhosts patch to fife_settings. Allows the user to load the gui 
    XML whenever they want. Also returns a reference to the dialog so it can be 
    worked with outside of fife_settings. (r3451)
  * Removed unused files containing the unused GUIEventListener class (r3453)
  * Removed old and unused functions: set/getSourceWidget() (r3455)
  * Added drawRectangle() and fillRectangle() functions to the renderers (r3456)
  * Modified FIFE::FloatingTextRenderer? to use the new functions (r3456)
  * Updated some data types in FIFE::FloatingTextRenderer to use integer types 
    defined in fife_stdint.h (r3456)
  * Added FIFE::DeviceCaps and FIFE::ScreenMode to detect valid screen modes
  * Added the ability to query the current running screen mode (r3467)
  * Added a method to detect the closest supported screen mode (not 
    complete yet). If no matching screen modes are detected an exception is 
    thrown. (r3467)
  * Small change to the way the screen is initialized. The screen mode now 
    MUST be in the supported screen mode list before the screen will 
    initialize. (r3467)
  * Added clearResourceLoaders() to the Pool class. This can be used if different 
    resourceloaders have to be added at a later point in time (running editor for 
    example, a plugin might want to have it's own loader added) (r3469)
  * Added the ability to normalize a 2D and 3D point (r3470)
  * You can now rotate a 2D point around the origin or a specific point (r3470)
  * Major improvements to fife_math.h and added corresponding Python bindings. 
    Users now have access to FIFE's internal math functions. These functions 
    are recommended to be used by all clients if required. Note: this may cause 
    some problems with certain compilers. I hope this wont have to be reverted. 
    TODO: remove the static constant globals somehow. (r3471)
  * Adopted the new math functions for all subsystems (r3471)
  * Added the ability to change screen modes on the fly. This works both in 
    OpenGL and SDL modes. (#315)
  * Added IEngineChangeListener so the client can update the cameras viewport 
    if the screen mode has been changed. I chose to do it this way because the 
    engine has no way to know which camera it should update. It will be up to 
    the client to do it. (#315)
  * The cursor surface is now correctly freed when exiting.  (r3483)
  * Added DeviceCaps::getNearestScreenMode() for the client to request a 
    supported screen mode. (#315)

  * Removed the XML portion out of fife_settings in favor of SimpleXMLSerializer
  * Made the serializer used in fife_settings "pluggable"
  * fife_settings widgets are now updated when the settings are reset to default
  * Can now specify the default settings filename instead of using 
    settings-dist.xml

    of instance visual when saving maps
  * Added getVolume() to the SoundManager
  * Added debug flag to loaders to enable/disable annoying print spam on maploading
  * BasicApplication now initializes pychan (r3388)
  * loaders extension can now handle multiple loaders for different filetypes. A 
    difference between map and object files is now being made! (r3469)
  * Modified the sound manager to better take care of sound clips (r3476)

================================================================================

=== Model improvements & simplifications ===
 * Elevations removed (Fallout legacy).
 * Support for namespaces:
  * New resource infrastructure migrated into whole engine. This enables:
   * uniform pooling for all resources that need to be pooled.
   * uniform loading for all resources (model stuff, images, sounds...).
   * uniform saving for resources which support saving (model stuff).
  * Datasets are now stored in a flat list in model instead of dataset 
    hierarchy.
  * Changes in model are now bookkeeped. Observer interfaces provided for change 
    listeners.
   * This enables e.g. reacting only to changes instead of polling on every 
     round.
   * Also critical enabler for triggers.
  * Instances now support initial rotation value.
  * Objects support default actions.
  * Further model cleanup.

=== XML format changes ===
 * All resources are now defined with principle 1 file / 1 resource.
 * Importing of objects can now be done also based on directories where they are 
   contained.
 * Relative paths are now used instead of absolute ones.

=== Loaders ===
 * All loading happens now from python (tinyxml dependency removed).
 * Improved error reporting.

=== Editor ===
 * Possibility to move instances on map.
 * Possibility to rotate instances on map.
 * Possibility to zoom the map (OpenGL mode only).
 * Painting with currently selected instance (e.g. large ground areas).
 * Importing of multiple objects based on given directory.
 * Initial map creation wizard (still work in progress).

=== Rio de hola ===
 * More assets:
  * Graphics, sounds, music...
  * Two new maps matching the storyline.
  * Rio de hola now conforms to package structure: 
    http://wiki.fifengine.de/Fife_Package_Specification
  * Popup menu integration, demonstration of actions (kick, talk).

=== Pychan improvements ===
 * Hiding of scrollbars.
 * Text wrapping.

 * Distance calculations made easy, exposed to scripts.
 * Instance outlining.
 * Instance coloring.
 * Screenshots are now saved in png format (instead of bmp).
 * Stereo sound support in linux (introduced with the help of openal-soft).

=== Video / view improvements ===
 * Both renderbackend and separate images can now render graphical primitives 
   (e.g. lines, dots..).
 * Each camera now has separate set of renderers. Allows truly adjusting cameras 
   independently.
 * Zooming capability (currently properly supported only by OpenGL backend).
 * Support for drag cursor definitions.
 * OpenGL graphics chunking size is now definable in settings. Should help e.g. 
   with large backgrounds.

== 0.3.3 (October 6th, 2011)                                                  ==
================================================================================

=== Engine ===
  * Many optimizations/improvements to the OpenGL renderer.  Depth testing was 
    modified and now works properly with alpha blending enabled.  Alpha testing
    is used to discard pixels. [t:556]
  * Optimized color overlays. [t:539]
  * Customizable alpha threshold value for outlines / outlining [t:569]
  * Added support for drawing/modifying images. [t:553]
  * Re-implemented the Resouce Pools (ImagePool AnimationPool, etc) as 
    ImangeManager, SoundClipManager, etc. [t:504]  
  * Setting module no longer crashes when settings dialog has not been loaded.
    [t:555]
  * Fixed the problem that the objects of the renderers don't get deallocated 
    when the camera deconstructor was called. Affected renderers: Instance-, 
    Cellsection-, Generic- and LightRenderer.
  * Added the missing reset() and removeAll() functions to the GenericRender 
    and LightRenderer.
  * Removed the Engine::preInit() function.
  * Removed EngineSetting::getPossibleResolutions() and validate() functions
  * EngineSettings no longer throws any exceptions. Instead default values as 
    assigned and a warning message is sent to the logger.
  * Some optimizations to LayerCache and Camera
  * Removed some unnecessary includes.
  * Changed when some exceptions are thrown. [t:511]  
  * Added setBackgroundColor(), so a client can change the clearing color for 
    the screen. [t:307]
  * Added camera overlay functions. Clients can now add a color, image and 
    animation overlay to the camera [t:460]
  * Made sure that the fife logger is part of the FIFE namespace.
  * Modifying all integer definitions to conform to the C99 standard.
  * Added the getMinMaxCoordinates() function to the map class. It retrieves 
    the minimum/maximum coordinates of instances on the map.
  * Changed Model::getNumMaps() to Model::getMapCount().
  * Changed Map::getNumLayers() to Map::getLayerCount().
  * Changed Animation::getNumFrames() to Animation::getFrameCount().
  * FifeClass is no longer derived from IReferenceCounted.
  * ResourceClass now implements the reference counting routines.
  * Singletons are no longer derived from FifeClass.
  * Modified the HexGrid? and SquareGrid? clone process to work as expected 
    (even though it's not really used). This doesn't fix the obvious problems 
    with CellGrid? and the way grids are created. This will have to be looked 
    at closer in the future.
  * Made the quad tree depth easily changeable (instead of hard coded to 2)  .
  * SquareGrid? now uses diagonals by default.
  * Model now logs to the LM_MODEL log module.
  * Small modifications to Exception to make it output to the log correctly. 
    Now we can read the exception output.
  * Changed a few sqrt to match the new math definition.
  * Added layers getMinMaxCoordinate() function to python.
  * Renaming the only 2 .hpp files to conform to standards.
  * Optimized the lightrenderer a bit.
  * Fixed a build error on updating project files. This was caused by not 
    installing the mingw part in the devkit installer.
  * Added code to support different versions of boost filesystem. [t:529]
  * Fixed some color variables (Uint8, int32_t to uint8_t).
  * Added some code to the python build environment to support python 2.4+.
    [t:465]
  * Fixed a segfault in the view_tests.py unittest.
  * Settings now list valid screen modes. [t:494]
  * the default image loader now throws exceptions if the image fails to load.
  * Fixed a bug in RawData::read where an incorrect calculation was done to 
    check the validity of a passed in parameter. This caused a problem with 
    loading asset files when the file did not have an appended new line at the 
    bottom. Also modified the RawData::getDataInBytes, RawData::readString, and
    RawData::read methods so that they do not create a temporary data array and
    instead read directly into the output buffer, this should be more efficient.
    Added a quick comment to xmlobject.py describing why a raise call is 
    subverted by an earlier return statement. [t:516]
  * Removes an unnecessary call from endFrame().
  * Fixed some unittests.
  * Added a framerate limiter. [t:525]
  * Replaced the Generic- and LightRendererNode with RendererNode.
  * Fixed the distance calculation in routepather.cpp.
  * Added the OffRenderer. This is the only renderer that does not need a map 
    or camera. The functions are identical to those of the GenericRenderer, 
    but it use screen coordinates. This renderer is only intended for cases 
    where no map is loaded, eg for an intro.
  * Changed the swig video_tests.py to use the new renderer.
  * Removed the primitives and a few other functions from the python interface. 
    These are no longer needed.
  * Added the swig cursor unit test.
  * Added some getter functions to cursor along with some documentation.
  * RenderItem now stores an ImagePtr.
  * Fixed SharedPtr destructor. [t:561]
  * Added the getInstancesIn() function to Layer. This picks the Instances from
    the InstanceTree.
  * Fixed getMatchingInstances(). The picked instances be checked with the 
    instances of the layer. To compare the instances, getInstancesIn() is used.
    [t:562]
  * Unnecessary InstanceActivity? are now detected and deleted. Inactive 
    Instances are removed from Layer m_active_instances. [t:564]
  * Changed from using RawData::getDataInBytes to use RawData::readString in 
    the animation/atlas/object/map loaders because the readString function 
    appends a null terminator onto the end of the data contents. Without the 
    null terminator errors were sometimes seen when trying to load map assets. 
  * Added some error log printing indicating when map assets fail to load.
    [t:567]
  * Modified the RawData::read function so that it no longer appends a null 
    terminator as this was causing the python xml loaders to throw a 
    ParseError exception. Also fixed the RawData::readString function so that 
    it now appends the null terminator in the proper place. [t:567]
  * Made scons check for the dev libraries of whatever python the user ran 
    scons with. [t:523]
  * Fixed a  problem where pychan will throw an exception when trying to print 
    UTF8 characters to the console. [t:571]
  * Fixed and optimized a few functions in location.cpp. [t:563] and [t:568]
  * Added option --lib-dir to scons build system to specify a shared library 
    install location. The shared library generated will now contain an soname 
    that will be libfife.so.major. Also changed the generated shared library 
    name to be libfife.so.major.minor.release. Added a version.h file to 
    engine/core that will contain the current fife major, minor, and subminor 
    versions and should be updated for each fife release. [t:575]  
  * Fixed minor bug in getMatchingInstances(). This means that sometimes a wrong
    choice was made, because alpha value was not correct.
  * Change the way you set FIFE::Cursor to allow cursor to save a reference to 
    the image or animation. Added a function to reset the cursor drag to 
    nothing.
  * Added GLee - currently it's compiled with fife as .cpp (scons doesn't get 
    compiled .c files).
  * Initial support for c++ map/object/animation loaders. [t:491]
  * Added dependency tinyxml for reading xml files. This is stored in 
    engine/core/ext/tinyxml directory. The scons scripts will attempt to use 
    system version of tinyxml if available otherwise the local one will be used.
    [t:491]
  * Added image Atlas support. [t:542] 
  * Added a zoom flag to the image/animation functions of the GenericRenderer. 
    So a client can disable the zoom for images. [t:543]
  * Fixed a bug that caused the generated SWIG interface file for fife to not 
    compile when building with gcc 4.6.1. [t:546]
  * Began work on de-coupling FIFE from guichan. [t:549]
  * Changed Guichan graphics renderer to utilize vertex array instead of 
    immediate mode. [t:549]
  * Removed Abstract* classes in favor of I* classes. This is to conform to our 
    coding standards. [t:550]
  * After a new layer is added it is now activated for all renderers. This fixes
    the problem of no instances being rendered for a newly created layer. 
    [t:551]
  * Added the option to change the alpha value for instance picking.
  * Added a setting for backbuffer clearing. So clients can deactivate it if 
    they have reasons for this.
  * Removed the old setImageChunkingSize() setting because its useless.
  * Changed the pump function. Model update gets only called if a map is loaded.
  * Adding a quick and dirty shared pointer implementation that does not rely 
    on any 3rd party libraries. This will need to be extensively tested and can 
    always be swapped out for another implementation including 
    boost::shared_ptr.
  * Added the unittest for SharedPtr.
  * Instances now inherit blocking property from objects [t:514]
  * Settings are now validated. [t:528]
  * VFS now allows paths outside of launched applications when using a python
    client. [t:544]
  * Reworked the lighting module.  [t:557]
  * The Windows icon is now freed correctly. [t:530]
    
=== Demos ===
  * Fixed a bug in the shooter demo that caused a crash. [t:495]
  * Updating the rio settings-dist.xml file to include the log level filter 
    setting.
  * Added animated percentagebar widget to gui animation demo.
  * Pychan demo now closes when you press escape or when you close the window. 
    [t:531]
  * Shooter demo now generates a hichscore file if one does not exist.

=== Documentation ===
  * Documented the shooter World.reset() function.
  * Updating the dependency graphs. [t:554]
  * Documented all valid FIFE settings. [t:527]

=== Extensions ===
  * Updated basicapplication.py to initialize the logger before settings so 
    that setting messages will be logged.
  * Removed some deprecated functions in pychan.
  * Removed the deprecated ClickLabel widget from pychan. [t:552]
  * Added changeBlending() to python.

=== Tools ===
  * Editor no longer crashes when there are too many instances on the map when
    using the OpenGL renderer. [t:500]
  * Added Atlas Creator tool. Currently it's a standalone application written 
    in Qt. [t:541]

    functions to set an alpha value for geometric figures
  * floatingtextrenderer now can change colors of the font via 
    setColor(uint r, uint b, uint g)

  * Small change to the way the screen is initialized. The screen mode now 
    MUST be in the supported screen mode list before the screen will 
    initialize. (r3467)
  * Added clearResourceLoaders() to the Pool class. This can be used if 
    different resourceloaders have to be added at a later point in time 
    (running editor for example, a plugin might want to have it's own loader 
    added) (r3469)

  * You can now rotate a 2D point around the origin or a specific point (r3470)
  * Major improvements to fife_math.h and added corresponding Python bindings. 
    Users now have access to FIFE's internal math functions. These functions 
    are recommended to be used by all clients if required. Note: this may cause 
    some problems with certain compilers. I hope this wont have to be reverted. 
    TODO: remove the static constant globals somehow. (r3471)
  * Adopted the new math functions for all subsystems (r3471)
  * Added the ability to change screen modes on the fly. This works both in 
    OpenGL and SDL modes. (#315)
  * Added IEngineChangeListener so the client can update the cameras viewport 
    if the screen mode has been changed. I chose to do it this way because the 
    engine has no way to know which camera it should update. It will be up to 
    the client to do it. (#315)

  * Some improvements to Scons build scripts
  * Prepared basicapplication to use WindowTitle and WindowIcon from clients' 
    settings.py
  * Logger now ignores non-existing log modules (warns to prompt)
  * Pools now have a function called purgeLoadedResources which deletes all 
    loaded resources that have a reference count of zero.
  * Movie: Switched to using FIFE::Image instead of Overlays
  * Reworked matrix vector multiplication
  * OpenAL-soft patch for OSS support

Optimizations:
  * Added hasing to pool to improve techdemo loading time
  * Lazy loading for animations
  * Combined events to reduce lag
  * Small optimizations for instance renderer

Bugs:

================================================================================
== 2008.1 (July, 2008)                                                        ==
================================================================================

=== Model improvements & simplifications ===
 * Elevations removed (Fallout legacy).
 * Support for namespaces:
  * New resource infrastructure migrated into whole engine. This enables:
   * uniform pooling for all resources that need to be pooled.
   * uniform loading for all resources (model stuff, images, sounds...).
   * uniform saving for resources which support saving (model stuff).
  * Datasets are now stored in a flat list in model instead of dataset 
    hierarchy.
  * Changes in model are now bookkeeped. Observer interfaces provided for change 
    listeners.
   * This enables e.g. reacting only to changes instead of polling on every 
     round.
   * Also critical enabler for triggers.
  * Instances now support initial rotation value.
  * Objects support default actions.
  * Further model cleanup.

=== XML format changes ===
 * All resources are now defined with principle 1 file / 1 resource.
 * Importing of objects can now be done also based on directories where they are 
   contained.
 * Relative paths are now used instead of absolute ones.

=== Loaders ===
 * All loading happens now from python (tinyxml dependency removed).
 * Improved error reporting.

=== Editor ===
 * Possibility to move instances on map.
 * Possibility to rotate instances on map.
 * Possibility to zoom the map (OpenGL mode only).
 * Painting with currently selected instance (e.g. large ground areas).
 * Importing of multiple objects based on given directory.
 * Initial map creation wizard (still work in progress).

=== Rio de hola ===
 * More assets:
  * Graphics, sounds, music...
  * Two new maps matching the storyline.
  * Rio de hola now conforms to package structure: 
    http://wiki.fifengine.de/Fife_Package_Specification
  * Popup menu integration, demonstration of actions (kick, talk).

=== Pychan improvements ===
 * Hiding of scrollbars.
 * Text wrapping.
 * A lot of smaller improvements. 

=== Functionality ===
 * Pixel perfect instance picking (taking transparency into account).
 * Ability to get list of instances from given screen rectangle.
 * Distance calculations made easy, exposed to scripts.
 * Instance outlining.
 * Instance coloring.
 * Screenshots are now saved in png format (instead of bmp).
 * Stereo sound support in linux (introduced with the help of openal-soft).

=== Video / view improvements ===
 * Both renderbackend and separate images can now render graphical primitives 
   (e.g. lines, dots..).
 * Each camera now has separate set of renderers. Allows truly adjusting cameras 
   independently.
 * Zooming capability (currently properly supported only by OpenGL backend).
 * Support for drag cursor definitions.
 * OpenGL graphics chunking size is now definable in settings. Should help e.g. 
   with large backgrounds.
 * GenericRenderer adding customised rendering capabilities for scripts.

=== Misc. changes ===
 * Initial package structure defined for FIFE clients.
 * Updated guichan to the latest release 0.8.1.
 * Usage of unittest++ instead of boost unittests.
 * Lots of bug fixes.

=== Non-code related changes ===
 * Switch from GPL 2.0 to LGPL 2.1 (or newer).

Pychan extension widgets.

Extension widgets are partly experimental, partly rarely used widgets
which are added here. They are by default not included in the widgets
registry and thus cannot be loaded from XML files. Use L{pychan.widgets.registerWidget}
to enable that.

Not the same care to keep the API stable will be taken for them and
before and if they are added (or replace) the standard widgets they
will have to be reviewed in detail.

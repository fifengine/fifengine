Automatic widget positioning
============================

You can use the C{position_techinque} attribute
on top level widgets which can also be set from xml.

For direct use call L{placeWidget}.

	Place a widget according to a string defining relative coordinates to screen borders.

	The position definition has to be of the form: C{"<x_pos><x_delta>:<y_pos><y_delta>"}

	C{<x_pos>} may be one of:
          - left
          - right
          - center
          - explicit

	C{<y_pos>} may be one of:
          - top
          - bottom
          - center
          - explicit

        C{explicit} means that the widgets x or y position will not be touched. The rest should be
        self explanatory.

	C{<x_delta>} and C{<y_delta>} must be of the form: +pixel_number or -pixel_number. Or comletely
        omitted. Note that the sign has to be there for for positive deltas, too.

	For brevity two shortcuts exist:
          - "explict" -> "explict:explict"
          - "automatic" -> "center:center"
        
	A few examples::
          "right-20:top"
          "center:top+10"
          "center:center"

	@param widget: The PyChan widget.
	@param position: A position definition.

	If the position cannot be parsed a L{PyChanException} is thrown.

"""
FIFE Backwards Combatibility Layer
==================================

This module can be imported if you want to
run code that wasn't adapted to API changes in FIFE.

2008.1
------

 - Animation.addFrame now expects a fife.ResourcePtr instead of an fife.Image
 - Pool.getIndex is just an alias for Pool.addResourceFromFile.
 - EventManager.setNonConsumableKeys is superseeded by EventManager.setKeyFilter
